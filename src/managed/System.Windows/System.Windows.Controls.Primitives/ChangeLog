	* Selector.cs: Don't try to handle ItemContainerStyle change
	  events in Selector as ComboBox and ListBox have different
	  semantics for some reason and it's impossible to do it
	  simply. Unregresses the ComboBox test.

2010-06-30  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: When changing Selector.ItemContainerStyle
	  ensure we replace all uses of the old style with the new
	  style regardless of whether the item is its own container.

2010-06-30  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selection.cs: Be less aggressive when updating the selection
	  properties on Selector. This fixes parts of cs2 where we'd
	  set a Binding on one of the selection properties and then
	  clear it too soon by setting the property to the value it
	  already had.

2010-06-30  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Don't ignore 'ignoreSelectedValue' here.

2010-06-29  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: ItemContainerStyle is only propagated to
	  generated containers, not to ComboBoxItems the user adds
	  directly.

2010-06-25  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* LayoutInformation.cs: For lack of a better place, store the
	  current LayoutExceptionElement on the deployment using the
	  attached property
	  LayoutInformation::CurrentExceptionElementProperty.

2010-06-18  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Updated to SL4 final API.

2010-05-31  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Throw exceptions properly when
	  IsSynchronisedWithCurrentItem is set to true. Copy the value
	  of ICV.CurrentItem to SelectedItem when we're syncing as
	  opposed to copying SelectedItem to ICV.CurrentItem. Fixes
	  more of 232.

2010-05-31  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: If there's a reset event, we need to either
	  select the old item (if it exists) or the CurrentItem of the
	  ICV if we have an ICV now.

2010-05-26  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: If we get a collection reset event, just
	  attempt to reselect the current selection.

2010-05-25  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs:
	* Selection.cs: Update the implementation of
	  Selector.SelectedItems to pass more of drt 232. Basically we
	  need to keep two copies of the list, one which is publicly
	  accessible by the user and one which is our private 'master'
	  list. We listen for changes to the public one and then
	  mirror them in the master list if they're valid. The public
	  list is always synced to the master one after any
	  modifications to the selection so that if the user does
	  something mad, we can revert that.

2010-05-24  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Fix drt cs2!

2010-05-24  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Call base.OnItemsSourceChanged first instead of
	  last. Otherwise the 'Items' list will be empty which will
	  cause any calls to Selection.Select to fail.

2010-05-24  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs:
	* Selection.cs: Be consistent with how we deal with the case
	  where the SelectedValueWalker is null so that everywhere
	  uses the same logic. Fixes more of cs2.

2010-05-24  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs:
	* Selection.cs: Fix more of drt cs2.

2010-05-21  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Add support for the new SelectedValue and
	  SelectedValuePath properties.

	* Selection.cs: Keep the new SelectedValue property in sync
	  aswell.

2010-05-21  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs:
	* Selection.cs: Merge two methods which handle selection
	  changes in Selector.cs to (hopefully) simplify the code a
	  bit.

2010-05-20  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Update SelectedItem immediately if we're
	  syncing with an ICV so that we don't wait for the first
	  "CurrentChanged" event to select the item. When the
	  selection is changed to null we need to synchronize that
	  with the ICV, so pull that code outside of the null check.

2010-05-17  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* GeneratorPosition.cs: Fix error CS0843 with newer compilers -
	just like CSC would not compile it previously

2010-04-13  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Added in missing default values.

2010-03-05  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Selector: Update to SL4 beta API.

2010-02-26  Mario Carrion  <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Overriding OnCreateAutomationPeer.

	r: toshok

2010-02-18  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: ClearContainerForItemOverride should not clear
	  the SelectedItem anymore.

2010-02-18  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selection.cs: Add support for the case where the user
	  directly modifies ListBox.SelectedItems.

2010-02-17  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Nuke ItemsControl.GetContainerItem along with
	  ListBoxItem.Item. This is all handled by
	  ItemContainerGenerator now. Move all the calls to
	  GetContainerItem to the corresponding ItemContainerGenerator
	  calls. 

2010-02-17  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Port to the new ItemContainerGenerator API when
	  setting IsSelected on ListBoxItems.

2010-02-09  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs:
	* Selector.cs:
	* LayoutInformation.cs: Fix compiler warnings.

2010-01-28  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selection.cs: If null is passed into the Select method, that
	  means we should deselect everything. Otherwise if an item is
	  passed in which is *not* in the ItemsControl.Items list, we
	  should deselect it if it's already selected. This happens
	  when the user removes an item from the Items list which is
	  selected.

	* Selector.cs: When we replace a selected item, we need to
	  deselect it rather than clearing all selected items.

2010-01-27  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs:
	* Selection.cs: Land initial support for multi-selection in
	  ListBox. moon-units will follow... eventually.

2010-01-27  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs:
	* Selection.cs: Create a helper class 'Selection' which will
	  be used to make it easier to keep SelectedItem and
	  SelectedIndex updated when handling the ListBox multiselect
	  logic.

2010-01-13  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* IRecyclingItemContainerGenerator.cs: cosmetic changes.

2010-01-06  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Implemented IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem support.

2009-12-22  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: 1) IsSelected should not be set to false when
	  clearing a container.
	2) The Content property of the container should only be set to
	  null if the container was autogenerated
	3) Keep SelectedItem/SelectedIndex updated when
	  adding/removing items from the Items collection.

2009-12-21  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: GetContainerItem should return UIElement
	  instead of ListBoxItem so that the method can be used with
	  ItemsControl.

2009-12-16  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* ItemsChangedEventArgs.cs: Made ctor internal.

2009-12-04  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* GeneratorPosition.cs: Implemented.

2009-12-01  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Add comment explaining a bug when focusing
	  elements inside Selector.

2009-11-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ItemsChangedEventArgs.cs: Flesh out this stub a little bit more.

2009-10-05  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Store the starting_generation and only_unemitted
	  flags on the EmitContext so that the values are used when we
	  call DoEmitCurrentContext from managed code. r: toshok

2009-09-28  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: ComboBox.ItemContainerStyle and
	  ListBox.ItemContainerStyle both should update the container
	  item Style value when they change. r: spouliot

2009-09-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Popup.cs: simplify this a bunch.  remove autogenerated events,
	and use a similar pattern as Events.cs for the OnOpened handler,
	which we register with the new Events.AddOnEventHandler method.
	(OnOpened): Call
	NativeMethods.event_object_do_emit_current_context from that
	method

	r: spouliot, andriea

2009-09-17  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Removed unused variable.

	r:kangaroo

2009-09-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Selector.cs: Add the SetAttributeDelayed attribute to the
	selected index property. This allows you to add children to a
	selector and set its initial selected index in xaml.

	r: spouliot

2009-09-04  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: If a ListBoxItem with IsSelected = true is
	  added to a Selector, that value is respected and
	  SelectedItem/Index is updated. r: sde

2009-09-03  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Remove code duplication - DisplayMemberPath
	  handling should only exist in ItemsControl. This fixes
	  DisplayMemberPath handling for ListBox too. r: sde

2009-09-02  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Only clear the selected item if its visual
	  container exists. If the visual container does *not* exist
	  then the container is just being created as part of
	  PrepareContainerForItemOverride in ComboBox so we can get
	  the correct ItemTemplate. r: toshok

2009-08-28  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Need to null check the catcher when trying to
	  update it. r: spouliot.

2009-08-28  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Updating the catcher from the LayoutUpdated event
	  leads to an infinite loop. Just update it when it's opened.
	  r: jeff

2009-08-26  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: ComboBox and ListBox should behave the exact
	  same way when a ListBoxItem is clicked, so share the
	  implementation. r: jackson

2009-08-26  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: ComboBox.IsSelectionActiveProperty and
	  ListBox.IsSelectionActiveProperty are the same DP reference,
	  so declare it on Selector and expose it in the subclasses.
	  Cleanup usage of this property aswell. r: spouliot

2009-08-25  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: When an item is selected before the container
	  item has been created, we need to set the 'IsSelected' flag
	  on the container when it loads. Fixes the initial selection
	  for both ComboBox and ListBox. r: jackson

2009-07-27  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: handle a possible source of errors.

2009-07-26  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Add some logic to update the catcher position on
	Layout changes.

2009-07-26  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: add another hack on top of the click catcher hack.  Is
	this really how it is supposed to work.

2009-06-26  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Fix some ListBox focus/selection related bugs.
	  Move ComboBox.OnSelectedItemChanged and
	  ListBox.OnSelectedItemChanged to Selector as they have
	  indentical codepaths after the last refactorings.

2009-06-25  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: When clearing the container, set the selected
	  item to null if that item used to be selected.

2009-06-25  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Move the handling of the ScrollViewer template
	  element and default values of ScrollbarVisibility to the
	  Selector class so it can be shared between ComboBox and
	  ListBox. Fix some default value issues too.

2009-06-25  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: cleanup - make 'changing' a property.

2009-06-24  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Add another method to selector to allow
	  subclasses to easily set the IsSelected property when the
	  SelectedItem changes.

2009-06-24  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: The only way to get the initial focus correct
	  for the drop down list in ComboBox is if it receives
	  notification of when its ComboBoxItems are loaded.

2009-06-11  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Make Popup.[Opened|Closed] asynchronous.

2009-06-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* LayoutInformation.cs (GetRawLayoutData): the MS test harness
	actually calls this undocumented private method... stub it out so
	that the test doesn't time out.

2009-05-25  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: SelectedItem is non-parenting, so it's
	not a core property.

2009-05-22  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Use DependencyProperty.RegisterCore for
	these DPs.

2009-05-21  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: SelectedIndex is actually updated on the
	virtual OnItemsChanged method, not in InvokeItemsChanged.

2009-05-21  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: SelectedItemProperty is non-parenting.
	
2009-05-20  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Ensure that SelectedIndex and SelectedItem
	are kept in sync. It is possible for Selected* to become
	out of sync with the actual value they should have, but
	this matches MS behaviour.

2009-05-20  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: OnItemsChanged is raised in ItemsControl,
	not Selector.
	  
2009-05-01  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: When raising the SelectionChanged event, we
	  need to always pass the old/new selected *item*, not the
	  SelectedIndex.

2009-04-23  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Allow popups to use a transparent canvas to catch
	  clicks outside of the popup area. ComboBox uses this to
	  close its popup.

2009-04-23  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Move the Notify* methods into Selector as both
	  Listbox and ComboBox require the same API.

2009-04-17  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Make IsSelectionActive work. Also make showing
	  the popup work. Currently no items are being displayed in
	  the popup as the ItemsPresenter is never getting loaded.

2009-04-17  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Correctly mark Popup.Child as its Content
	  property.

2009-04-16  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Implement ClearContainerForItemOverride and fix
	  some more virtual -> override issues.

2009-04-16  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Nothing appears to make
	  Selector.GetIsSelectionActive return true. The documentation
	  offers no hints either.

2009-04-16  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Route the collection changed event through the
	  Selector, fixes three tests.

2009-04-15  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: If the new value is null, Selector should not
	  revert to the old value.

2009-04-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* ScrollEventHandler.cs: Delete files we got from MS' controls
	  drop, and update project file to compile.

2009-04-02  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Popups are treated as top level elements which are
	  rendered on top of all other elements. To handle this a list
	  of all toplevel elements (layers) is kept in the surface.
	  Mouse events are captured within a toplevel element and not
	  visible to other toplevel elements.

2009-03-06  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Switch to using ObjectFromIntPtr to lookup objects.

2009-02-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Selector.cs (SelectedIndexProperty): the default of this is -1.

2009-02-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Selector.cs: add a couple of missing methods, and stop with the
	local caching of DP values.

2009-01-21  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Should be sending the native handle, the surface is
	automagically taken care of.

2009-01-20  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Popup.cs: Fix build

2009-01-20  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: When IsOpen is changed, we need to fire either Opened or
	Closed.

2009-01-19  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Popup.cs: Create an unmanaged peer for the Popup class

2009-01-16  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Simplified the caching implementation.

2009-01-16  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Attempt to match the MS caching mechanism for
	SelectedItem and SelectedValue

2009-01-16  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: When changing the SelectedItem, the SelectedIndex changes
	automatically. Only one SelectionChanged event is fired. Similarly
	for when SelectedIndex changes.

2009-01-15  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: SelectionChanged is now fired when either the Index or
	SelectedObject is changed

2009-01-15  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Selector.cs: Begin implementing ComboBox. First 3 tests now pass.

2009-01-13  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* IScrollInfo.cs: Internal interface to mimic WPF. This is needed 
	for API compatibility with ScrollContentPresenter (gui-compare)

2009-01-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Selector.cs: Add internal ctor and GetIsSelectionActive

2008-12-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Selector.cs: More bits.

2008-08-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* System.Windows.Controls.Primitives/Popup.cs: stub this class
	out.
