TOOLS

find-sc.exe

	Extract [SecurityCritical] from Silverlight platform code to
	ensure Moonlight compatibility. The output of the tool is kept
	under the /compatibility directory and its content is stored
	in SVN in order to track changes over time (and new SL releases)

detect.exe

	This tool will:
	1) Read all platform code assemblies;
	2) Mark types and methods that needs to be [SecurityCritical]
	to ensure compatibility. These are the /compatibility/*.compat.sc
	and are the results from the 'find-sc.exe' tool
	3) Mark types and methods that were manually identified to
	require [SecurityCritical] or [SecuritySafeCritical] attributes.
	They are read from /overrides/*.manual
	4) Detect code that requires [SecurityCritical] in order to work
	properly under the CoreCLR security model;
	5) Detect code that requires [SecuritySafeCritical] (anything
	calling SC) in order to work properly under the CoreCLR security
	model;
	6) Save the *.secattr files (one per assembly) that are usable
	by the linker to inject the security attributes inside the 
	Moonlight assemblies.

	Note: this new tools is a replacement for the previous 
	'detect-sc', 'detect-ssc' and 'merge' tools

audit.exe

	Detect new or updated [SecuritySafeCritical] methods in the 
	platform assemblies. Comments can be added when the method was
	reviewed - e.g. reviewer name and some useful notes for future
	reviewers

ivt-check.exe

	Check the specified assembly for its use of [InternalsVisibleTo]
	and report any assembly that is not platform code. This makes it
	possible to ensure our platform assemblies are not opening 
	themselves to external code.

ivt-detect.exe

	Detect all the required use of [InternalsVisibleTo] fields, 
	methods and types from the Moonlight/Silverlight platform code
	by the Microsoft SDK assemblies (Windows). Note: this tool is
	meant to be executed on Windows

ivt-compat.exe

	Check if the Moonlight platform code provides the required
	internal fields, methods and types to allow the successful
	execution of Microsoft (redistributable) SDK assemblies.

Note: the tools are not meant to be installed on the end-users system.
They are only needed at build-time.


FILES

/compatibility/*.compat.sc

	Files are generated, using find-sc.exe, from Silverlight 2.0 
	platform code. They contains the [SecurityCritical] attributes
	on visible API which are required for comaptibility.

/overrides/*.manual

	Manually updated files to add, or remove, security attributes.

/*.secattr

	Merged files, from the above sources, that are consumed by the
	tuner.

/audit/*.audit

	Audit data files. Auditor can add comments, while the audit.exe
	tool will update the files when new or updated SSC methods are
	detected.

/sl-#-sdk.internals

	Internals fields, methods and types required by Silverlight SDK
	version #
