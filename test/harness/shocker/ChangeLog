2010-07-14  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* shocker.cpp: Ensure we retain any NPObjects we return to the browser.

2010-06-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* shutdown-manager.cpp: Make a few printfs somewhat better and fix a compiler
	warning.

2010-06-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* harness.cpp: When looking for a window, actually set the window handle in
	the structure we return.

2010-06-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* shutdown-manager.cpp: Send ctrl-w to chrome, since WM_DELETE_WINDOW doesn't
	work. Hopefully there are no oob races, since oob apps seems to always be
	installed from firefox.

2010-06-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* shutdown-manager.cpp: Don't send neither ctrl-q nor alt-f4, it may mess up
	oob tests due to a race when starting oob apps.

2010-05-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* harness.cpp: GetWindowInfo: Add a hack to get the Window handle.

	* shutdown-manager.cpp: Use the above hack to send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message
	to oob apps instead of alt+f4/ctrl+q, which goes to the focused window - not
	necessarily where we want it to go.

2010-05-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* shocker.cpp (ShockerScriptableControlObject::MouseWheel): don't
	cast clicks to an unsigned type, we need to support negative
	values.

	* input.cpp,h (InputProvider::MouseWheel): the clicks parameter
	needs to be signed.
	(InputHelper_MouseWheel): same.

2010-04-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* shocker.cpp|h: Use new logging framework, and fail the current test
	instead of aborting when api that hasn't been implemented is called. Rewrite
	the shocker np object to be more c++-ish, so that most of the code can be
	reused in the newly implemented renderdatacapturer np object.

	* input.cpp:
	* netscape.cpp:
	* plugin.cpp|h:
	* harness.cpp|h:
	* logging.cpp|h:

	* plugin.cpp|h: Add a pinvokable method to get the location of the test
	plugin.

	* logging.cpp|h: Updated according to API changes. Remove runtime property
	storage, it's stored in the test harness now (since there might be several
	processes involved, and we need to store it in one place for all processes).

	* image-capture.cpp: Updated according to API changes.

	* harness.cpp|h: Added new window and process management methods. Put it all
	in a C++ class.

	* shocker.cpp:
	* netscape.cpp:
	* image-capture.cpp:
	* shutdown-manager.cpp: Add the pid to all printfs, to make output less
	confusing when there are multiple processes involved.

2010-04-15  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* input.cpp|h:
	* plugin.cpp|h:

	* browser.cpp|h:
	* harness.cpp|h:
	* netscape.cpp|h:

2010-04-15  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* shutdown-manager.cpp|h: Add another p/invokable signature. Send Alt-F4 too
	when trying to shut down, since ctrl+q won't work with oob apps.

2010-04-15  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* plugin.cpp: Chrome doesn't support !xembed.

2010-04-01  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* harness.cpp: Use the correct listen port in the shocker
	  harness.

2010-03-31  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* image-capture.cpp:
	* logging.cpp:
	* harness.cpp|h: The harness now sends a 4-byte header with the size of the
	data it is sending. Change harness_send_message to allocate the memory instead
	of reading into a pre-allocated buffer.

2010-03-31  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* harness.cpp (send_all): New convenience function.
	(recv_all): Same.
	(send_harness_message): Use the new convenience functions to
	send/recv all requested data.

2010-03-31  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* shocker.cpp:
	* logging.cpp|h: Implement GetPlatformVersion and GetPlatformName.

2010-03-31  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* logging.cpp: Fix warnings.

2010-03-30  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* logging.cpp|h: Added p/invokable TestHost_GetTestDirectory.

2010-03-30  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* image-capture.cpp: CompareImages: some drts are right and some are wrong
	about master/comparison file order. Add some AI to detect the correct answer.

2010-03-25  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* image-capture.cpp: CompareImages: drts are giving us the master and comparison

	* image-capture.cpp|h: Add a CompareImages method with the signature the
	drt test framework is p/invoking.

	* shocker.cpp: Use the CompareImages in image-capture, and rename the methods
	in here with the same name to avoid name clashes.

2010-03-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* shocker.cpp:

2010-01-25  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* shocker.cpp: NPAPI symbol renaming

2010-01-12  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* plugin.cpp|h: Try to make XY coordinates resilient against moving the
	window/plugin after creating it.

	r: lewing

2009-10-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* shutdown-manager.cpp: Up the timeout for the backup shutdown
	mechanism (exit) from 2.5 seconds to 25 seconds. This might prevent the
	resource loader tests from crashing.

	r: sde

2009-07-27  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* shocker.mdp: Use Makefile integration.

2009-07-17  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* input.cpp: Make the delay 3ms not 4ms, otherwise 786 times
	  out.

2009-07-17  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* input.cpp: Instead of using usleep and mouse moves with no
	  delay, use the delay property of XTestFakeMotionEvent to
	  ensure the mouse moves to the right location without
	  blocking the main loop. This allows 786 to complete
	  successfully.

2009-07-01  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* input.cpp: Ensure that we don't flip-flop around the target
	  point by moving closer by 1 pixel at a time when within 10
	  pixels of it. Fixes drt 551 (and maybe others?)

2009-07-01  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* shutdown-manager.cpp: #include stdlib.h and unistd.h for exit()
	and getenv().

	* plugin.cpp (Plugin_New): Fixed to actually return the value it
	was obviously meant to return. Also fixed undefined types errors.

	* input.cpp (SendKeyInput): There is no uint32, use guint32
	instead.

2009-07-01  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: Include the plugins moz-sdk directory.

2009-07-01  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* netscape.h: Include npfunctions.h instead of npupp.h. Seems
	to fix build after installing ff 3.5.

	* browser.cpp: Just call the function instead of calling the
	CallNPP_* macros.

2009-06-29  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* input.cpp: Speed up logarithmic mouse moving significantly
	  otherwise 557 can never pass. It currently times out less
	  than 50% of the way through the test as we spend too long
	  moving the mouse.

2009-06-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	* shocker.mdp: Updated with new files.

	* input.cpp: Add VK_KP_ADD to the key map.

2009-06-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* shocker.cpp (GetTestDirectory): at the very least return a valid
	path (and the valid type).

2009-05-02  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* shocker.cpp: fix define check

2009-05-02  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* shocker.cpp: added hack to track down the actual script error msgs
	that gecko insists on swallowing for some unfathomable reason. Only
	activated on debug mode and only if DEBUG_ERROR_GECKO is defined

2009-05-02  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* input.cpp: reset numlock back to false when done

2009-04-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* shocker.mdp: Add a project for each tool, and clean up some
	  of the existing projects.

	* input.h: Add license.

2009-04-03  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* netscape.cpp: Prevent firefox from unloading us in all
	  cases.

	* plugin.h:
	* plugin.cpp: Fetch the browser's toplevel window.

	* shocker.cpp: CaptureMultipleImages: only use the test path
	  as the destination filename if a path wasn't provided.

	* shutdown-manager.h:
	* shutdown-manager.cpp: Be nice to the browser and shut it
	  down in a clean way.

2009-04-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* image-capture.cpp: For multiple image capture don't assume
	  the requested file name doesn't have a tif extension, and
